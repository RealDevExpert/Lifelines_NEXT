Here are scripts and results for the not-very-extensive benchmark of tools offering bacterial flanking regions around prophages from putative virus contigs.

**Motivation**: Even though metaviromes for the Chiliadal virome project were generated using the VLP-enrichment technique, it is difficult to guarantee that all the putative virus sequences identified by the tools in the Virome Discovery framework are free of bacterial genomic contamination. Since there is no gold standard method to trim such bacterial contamination*, we have tested 7 existing tools that offer prophage pruning:
