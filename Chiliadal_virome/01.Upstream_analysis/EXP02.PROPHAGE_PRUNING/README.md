Here are scripts and results of the not very extensive benchmark of tools offering bacterial flanking regions around prophages from putative virus contigs.

Motivation: Even though metaviromes for the Chiliadal virome project were generated using VLP-enrichment technique, it is difficult to guarantee that all the putative virus sequences idntified by the tools in the Virome Discovery framework are free of bacterial contamination.
