To access sample information, basic phenotypes, family structure, and quality-trimmed sequencing reads from EGA, you need to follow the instructions provided below:

## Prerequisites
Firstly, read the [LLNEXT DATA ACCESS AGREEMENT](https://groningenmicrobiome.org/?page_id=2598). Access to the LLNEXT Project data will be granted 
to all qualified researchers and will be governed by the provisions laid out in this data access agreement.

Secondly, fill out the [Application Form for Access to Lifelines NEXT Data](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUaLZk6Smz66EAqgb0JmzyXLPF3V9mHdvWEuL98qT4yF1j5g/viewform) to indicate that you agree with LLNEXT DATA ACCESS AGREEMENT.
