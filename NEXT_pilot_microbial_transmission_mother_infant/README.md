You can download the current version of the paper via: [[DOI]] (add the link to preprint).

## One-Sentence Summary
We studied the dynamics of the maternal virome during and after pregnancy, the infant virome during early life, with a particular focus on the transmission of viral strains from mothers to their infants. 

## Abstract
(Will be accessible upon preprint submission)

## Data availability
Sample information, basic phenotypes, family structure and raw sequences will be made available in the EGA archive before publication (study ID: EGAS00001005969).
